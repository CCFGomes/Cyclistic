After analyzing the data, it was possible to finally answer the question of "how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

The findings can be visualized on Tableau at [Cyclistic Data Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carla.gomes6477/viz/Cyclistic_Data_Analysis_17011283227880/Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Case_Study#2)


# Findings:

Based on the data analysis, several key findings have emerged:

Ride Frequency: Members tend to perform more rides compared to Casual users, with approximately 38% higher ride counts. However, Casual users typically ride longer distances, averaging around 50% more in terms of distance covered.

Ride Duration: Casual users spend significantly more time per ride compared to Members, with an average of 50% more time spent riding.

Preferred Bike Type: Both Casual users and Members show a preference for docker bikes.

Weekly Patterns: For Casual users, there is a noticeable increase in the number of rides on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, followed by a sharp decline on Tuesdays. However, the ride frequency gradually increases again throughout the week, peaking during the weekend. This weekly pattern results in a significant difference of approximately 56% between the busiest and quietest days. In contrast, Members exhibit minimal variation, with a difference of no more than 13% between weekdays.

Average Ride Length: The average ride length for Casual users is approximately 2771 seconds, equivalent to 46 minutes. In contrast, Members have significantly shorter average ride lengths, averaging around 850 seconds or 14 minutes.

Peak Long Rides: Sunday stands out as the day with the highest number of long rides for both Casual users and Members. On the other hand, Tuesday shows the lowest ride distances across both user groups.

These findings provide valuable insights into the riding behavior and preferences of Members and Casual users. They can inform decision-making processes related to marketing strategies, resource allocation, and overall business growth.


# Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing Campaigns: The data shows that casual riders tend to ride longer distances and spend more time riding than members. This insight can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns highlighting the flexibility and convenience of casual riding, emphasizing the ability to ride for longer durations without the commitment of an annual membership.

Pricing and Subscription Strategies: The data reveals that members perform more rides than casual users. This information can inform pricing and subscription strategies, such as offering discounted rates for frequent riders or introducing flexible membership options for those who ride occasionally. Adjusting pricing and subscription models to cater to the usage patterns of both casual riders and members can encourage more conversions.

Enhancing User Experience: The finding that both categories of users prefer docked bikes suggests that ensuring an adequate supply of docked bikes in popular areas can improve the user experience. By analyzing the data on popular ride times and locations, Cyclistic can optimize bike availability and distribution to meet user demand.

Customer Retention: Although the focus is on converting casual riders into members, it's essential to maintain a positive relationship with existing members. The data indicates that members ride consistently throughout the week, while casual riders show variations in their riding patterns. By providing targeted incentives and rewards for members, Cyclistic can enhance member loyalty and reduce churn.

Operational Efficiency: Analyzing the busiest and quietest days for both user categories can help optimize resource allocation and operational efficiency. By aligning staffing levels, bike maintenance schedules, and marketing efforts to match demand fluctuations, Cyclistic can improve overall operational performance.

Partnerships and Collaborations: By identifying the preferred ride days and average ride length for each user category, Cyclistic can explore partnerships with local businesses or event organizers to offer targeted promotions and incentives on specific days. This can encourage ridership and attract new customers, including casual riders who may be more inclined to use the service during certain events or weekends.

# Final Conclusion
Based on the analysis conducted, several key insights have emerged regarding the behavior and preferences of Members and Casual users. Members tend to have higher ride frequencies, while Casual users ride longer distances and spend more time per ride. Both user groups show a preference for docker bikes. Weekly patterns indicate significant variations in ride frequency for Casual users, with peak activity on weekends and a decline on Tuesdays. Members exhibit more consistent ride patterns throughout the week. Sunday emerges as the day with the highest number of long rides for both groups, while Tuesday has the lowest ride distances.

# Application of Insights:
The team and business can leverage these insights in several ways. Firstly, the marketing team can design targeted campaigns to attract more Casual users and convert them into Members by emphasizing the benefits of membership, such as increased ride frequency. Additionally, the operations team can allocate resources accordingly, ensuring an adequate supply of docker bikes to meet the demand. By tailoring marketing strategies and resource allocation based on user preferences and weekly patterns, Bellabeat can enhance user engagement and drive business growth.

# Next Steps:
Based on these findings, the next steps would involve implementing the recommended strategies and closely monitoring their impact on user behavior. The marketing team can track the conversion rate of Casual users to Members after targeted campaigns and assess any changes in ride frequency and user satisfaction. Continuously analyzing and refining marketing efforts based on user data will help optimize results and further drive growth.

# Additional Data:
To expand on these findings, additional data sources could be explored. Collecting demographic information about users, such as age, gender, and location, would provide deeper insights into specific user segments. Integration of weather data could help identify weather-related trends influencing ride patterns. Moreover, conducting surveys or gathering feedback from users can provide qualitative insights into their preferences, motivations, and overall user experience. By combining these additional data sources with the existing findings, a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior and opportunities for improvement can be achieved.
